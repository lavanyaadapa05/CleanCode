# CleanCode
 an AI-driven chatbot that evaluates code cleanliness based on Clean Code principles. The chatbot provides feedback on uploaded code files and user queries using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
## Overview

This project is an **AI-powered chatbot** that evaluates code cleanliness based on the principles outlined in *Clean Code* by **Robert C. Martin**. The chatbot provides structured feedback on uploaded code files and user queries, helping developers write better, maintainable code.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Gradio** (for interactive UI/UX)
- **Gemini Pro (Google Generative AI)** (via LangChain for AI-driven responses)
- **LangChain** (for Retrieval-Augmented Generation - RAG)

## Features

âœ… **Interactive Chatbot Interface** for real-time code analysis and feedback\
âœ… **File Upload Support** for multiple programming languages\
âœ… **AI-Generated Insights** based on *Clean Code* principles\
âœ… **Structured Code Review Feedback** to improve maintainability

## Workflow

1. **User Query or File Upload**: Users can ask code-related questions or upload source code files.
2. **Context Retrieval**: The chatbot fetches relevant insights from *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin.
3. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Using Gemini Pro, the model evaluates the code's quality and adherence to clean coding practices.
4. **Feedback Generation**: The chatbot provides insights on improvements and best practices.
